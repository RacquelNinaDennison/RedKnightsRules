				<h1>Redknight Rules</h1>
			</div>

			<div className='rules'>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Mics:</b> We want everyone to have a mic so
						we can understand what everyone is trying to do
						on the pitch, so we can improve our plays and
						avoid confusion.
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>
							Aggressive/offensive behavior/bad language:
						</b>
						<br />
						We have worked so hard to create a conducive
						environment, where it is a joy to play for
						Redknights and we set a good example for our
						teammates and our fans/viewers. We want all
						members to practice self control as we are all
						mature individuals regardless of our ages.
						<p>
							<br />
							<b>
								Note: It may be a challenge to achieve this
								for some of us, but with any change in life,
								this is a gradual process, but we expect
								every member to make a recognizable effort
								to achieving this
							</b>
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Yes we get frustrated when things don‚Äôt go
							away our way, but we‚Äôre a family and we trust
							that everyone is trying to make the best
							possible decision for the team. Over
							everything DONT tune each other.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Punctuality & Attendance: </b> We value being
						on time for fixtures, as we respect every
						opponent and respect our teammates time as well.
						We have work/school and other responsibilities,
						so we value the sacrifices made by each player
						to make themselves available and help the team
						achieve our goals. Please make use of the
						availability sheet as this helps us captains use
						to decide our squad lineup. More attendance
						means more games.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Line ups:</b> We value each and every member
						of our team and see the quality each member adds
						to the team, hence why you are apart of the
						team. Line ups are determined based on training
						attendance, availability, form and competitive
						abilities. When selecting a line up, we put the
						team first and not make decisions based on
						personal preferences. We encourage each member
						to avail themselves for our warm up games, so we
						can maintain our teams chemistry and carry the
						momentum gathered from those matches into our
						competitive matches.
